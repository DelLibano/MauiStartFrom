# MauiStartFrom
Clone this repository when starting a new .NET MAUI APP. It's ready for localization, the en-US (default language) is configured, and the it-IT as the other language, both selectable by the user from the bottom of the Flyout on the Shell page.
## Note
Selecting the other language will force the app to Quit to guarantee that all the other language aspects are loaded correctly from the start.
